1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I didn't have to look for it through
the whole file, but jius the changes.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You'll not spend much time on looking for bugs and you'll not loose your previous versions if something goes wrong

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros : You can choose right size of changes, not too small, not too big
Cons: You can forgot about it, so you can loose everything you wrote

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Depends on purpous for which it has been made

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Apropperiate

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

My own great project
